Do you know name and surname of a person but you need his email?
This is the perfect tool to find it out!

The tool works as follow:
Create an input file in the same directory as the other files and name it "people.txt".
Here you should insert name and surname and company of the poeple whose email you want to find out.
One person per line in this way: name surname company
Example:    luca gallinari google

Then you need to insert your email and password in both mailer.js and receiver.js and then the job is done!
